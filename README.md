# HarsanyiNet
This repository contains the Python implementation for HarsanyiNet, "HarsanyiNet: Computing Accurate Shapley Values in a Single Forward Propagation", ICML 2023.

HarsanyiNet is an interpretable network architecture, which makes inferences on the input sample and simultaneously computes the exact Shapley values of the input variables in a single forward propagation (see [papers]() for details and citations).

## Install
HarsanyiNet can be installed in the Python 3 environment:

`pip install git+https://github.com/csluchen/harsanyinet`



## How to use
### HarsanyiNet-CNN
To train CIFAR-10 dataset quickly, you can use the following code:

`python train.py`

To train MNIST dataset quickly, you can use the following code:

`python train.py --dataset='MNIST'`


### HarsanyiNet-MLP
