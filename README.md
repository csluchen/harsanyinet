# HarsanyiNet
This repository contains the Python implementation for HarsanyiNet, "HarsanyiNet: Computing Accurate Shapley Values in a Single Forward Propagation", ICML 2023.

HarsanyiNet is an interpretable network architecture, which makes inferences on the input sample and simultaneously computes the exact Shapley values of the input variables in a single forward propagation (see [papers]() for details and citations).

## Install
HarsanyiNet can be installed in the Python 3 environment:
'''
pip install git+https://github.com/csluchen/harsanyinet

'''


## How to use
### HarsanyiNet-CNN



### HarsanyiNet-MLP
