# HarsanyiNet
This repository contains the Python implementation for HarsanyiNet, "HarsanyiNet: Computing Accurate Shapley Values in a Single Forward Propagation", ICML 2023.

HarsanyiNet is an interpretable network architecture, which makes inferences on the input sample and simultaneously computes the exact Shapley values of the input variables in a single forward propagation (see [papers]() for details and citations).

## Install
HarsanyiNet can be installed in the Python 3 environment:

`
pip install git+https://github.com/csluchen/harsanyinet
`

In addition, the `torchtoolbox` package needs to be installed:

`
pip install torchtoolbox
`



## How to use easily
### HarsanyiNet-CNN
#### Get HarsanyiNet model
To train CIFAR-10 dataset easily, you can use the following code:

`
python train.py
`

Or you can directly access the pre-trained HarsanyiNet in path `A`.

To train MNIST dataset easily, you can use the following code:

`python train.py --dataset='MNIST'`


Or you can directly access the pre-trained HarsanyiNet in path `B`.

#### Compute Shapley values by HarsanyiNet
Now you can use the trained HarsanyiNet to compute the Shapley values in a single forward propagation, you can use the following code like:

`
python shapley.py 
`





### HarsanyiNet-MLP



## More details
#### Compare Shapley values computed by HarsanyiNet and Other methods

If you want to compute the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the Shapley values computed by HarsanyiNet and that computed by sampling method, you can use the following code:

`
python shapley.py --sampling=True --runs=2000
`

Or you can directly access the sampling result in path `C`.



For image dataset, if you want to compute the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the Shapley values computed by HarsanyiNet and that computed by sampling method, you can use the following code:
`
python shapley.py ...
`
